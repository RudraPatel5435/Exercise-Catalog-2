# Workout Catalog and a Workout Program (College 1st Sem Project)
<h3>Give a shake to that overgrown body.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The first page gives you a quick overview of the entire website - the benefits of exercise and a sneak peek at all the other pages.
</li>
  <li>Workout Plan: This page gives you a list of exercises for 4 days, hitting all the muscles in your body.</li>
  <li>Muscle Specific Exercises: This page is like a filter box that initially shows all the exercises, but you can filter them out by muscle type using the buttons provided.</li>
  <li>Contact Us: There are some fields where you can enter information, but it doesn’t seem to go anywhere. This page was required from my college, so I made it, but it’s not doing anything useful.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Good luck!</h3>
