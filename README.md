  <li>The first page gives a overview of the entire website - benefits of exercise and a glipse of all other pages on the website.</li>
  <li>Workout Plan: This pages gives you a list of exercises for 4 days hitting all muscles on your body.</li>
  <li>Muscle Specific Exercises: It is a filter based container that initially shows all exercises but you can filter muscle specific exercises from the provided buttons.</li>
